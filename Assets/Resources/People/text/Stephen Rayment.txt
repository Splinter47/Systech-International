Stephen co-founded Systech International in 1991 with Mark Woodward-Smith and he is the Group Mana ging Director with responsibility for the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Americas regions. Stephen is also responsible for all strategic and policy matters. Under Stephen’s leadership Systech has developed into a leading global construction consultancy with a reputation for high quality, managed services.

Stephen takes a hands-on role in the support of our contractor clients, specialising in the preparation of contractual claims, advising on project specific commercial strategies and leading dispute resolution teams in international arbitrations. He also manages our global framework agreements with major international contractors.

Stephen took the business global in 1994 supporting the ‘Tiger Economies’ in the Asia Pacific region and opening permanent offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. He then lead the group to expand into the Middle East and the America's markets, opening regional offices in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Atlanta, Houston, Rio de Janeiro and Toronto, as well as opening additional Asia Pacific offices in Australia, Japan and Korea.

Stephen looks to add strength to the business through the addition of key services such as the recent acquisition of Systech Solicitors, the first of its kind under the Legal Services Act, allowing the business to offer a unique combination of project, claims, dispute resolution and legal services under a single brand.

Stephen is a Fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and a Member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.
